# RiseFit-AI
## Inspiration ðŸ˜‰
The benefits of exercise are clear from a mental and physical standpoint, we have all heard about them. 
However, during the time of social distancing and the pandemic, thereâ€™s been a growing apathy to exercise at home with energy and intensity due to various reasons. Personally, my health started deteriorating with the onset of the pandemic due to limited physical exercise and lack of proper training. On researching more about this, I found most people don't have access to gyms and personal fitness trainers due to various reasons.
Most people in third-world countries can't afford the costs of a gym. In rural and countryside areas, gyms are very rare. Another big reason is that for some women, going to a physical gym is extremely daunting. A new study has revealed nearly three-quarters of women have been made to feel uncomfortable whilst at the gym. Sports nutrition brand DNA Lean surveyed 400 women and found 73 percent of them have been made to feel uncomfortable whilst working out. 
This research proved that this problem is very undermined and needs to be worked upon. It also made me realize that the audience that could be potentially impacted through this app is huge. Good fitness is a requirement of every human being regardless of any disparity. But the obstacles faced by different people in attaining good fitness are countless. This could be a solution to them all
## What it does ðŸ˜Ž
RiseFit AI is a smart machine-learning-based personal fitness trainer. It monitors a person while they exercise at home. Risefit AI provides real-time exercise feedback to the user, counts their reps, and monitors the number of calories they burned. All you need is a webcam and a working internet connection!
## How I built it ðŸ˜™
For building the project, I started with learning some requirements and technologies that I was previously unfamiliar with, then I started with coding the machine learning algorithm to detect your exercise and count your reps. I coded a complex algorithm that was based on a lot of Vector analysis and angle calculation stuff using the ML5 library, JavaScript and Posenet architecture. After completing the AI part, I coded the UI of the application using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Then I integrated the frontend with the model. I used P5js library to design the canvas and annotations on the webcam feed. After this I successfully completed the application, after which I used firebase and github to host it online.
## Challenges I ran into ðŸ˜³
Building this app was a complex process, I faced lots of challenges throughout my journey, the prominent ones are as follows:
1. I started with the wrong tech stack for my application which caused me to reconfigure my thoughts and restart the application design process due to a major incompatibility between two technologies
2. I faced lots of issues in hosting the application, tried and explored several options, hosted multiple times but the only successful one was the combo of firebase + github

Indeed these obstacles were tough and tedious but with the support, the motivation, the guidance and the GRIT that RISE gave me, I landed solutions to all my problems. The whole discord server, the community, the mentors played a very important role in my journey. And now when it's ending, I feel ultimately satisfied and accomplished for creating such a project!
